Sudoku_Solver_ISP
=================
This project present a program that solves Sudoku puzzles. 
It was  a part of my intelligent systems programing course at the ITU. 
My work is limited to the forward-checking algorithm that is used in the solve() method in the SudokuSolver class. 
Sometimes in the future I also plan on revising the rest of the methods that came with that class.
